                I have tried several times to turn my passion of artwork into some kind of profitable hobby. A struggle so common
                to artists but certainly not unique to them. I would spend hours of my time scrolling through Instagram or on Youtube 
                looking at the art of those that I deemed successful whether in technical ability or marketing genius. This is something
                that all of us can relate to as an artist or not. In this time where things seem so hazy and economically demanding it is 
                easy to try and the things that we do mindlessly and enjoyably into sources of income. Here is a bit of my story:
                </p>
                
                <p>
                In the Fall of 2021, I just come off of active duty while training to be a weather
                forecaster in the Marine Corps Reserves. My short time (and year a half) on active duty was demanding. 
                I worked hard to be at peak physical fitness during boot camp, and I studied extremely hard to be at the top of my class in MOS school and while 
                taking on several leadership opportunities throughout my time there.
                </p>

                <p> 
                On top of the general stress, this all took place during 2019-2021. We were confined to a small area of Keesler Air Force Base 
                known as the Triangle where the student barracks were. Our brief time outside of that entailed marching to the base commissary with seabags across our backs 
                shoveling two weeks worth of toilet paper (if it was there) and groceries into them and marching back through the hot, dense Mississippi air.
                </p>

                <p>
                Needless to say, I was bored out of my mind on those weekends. And like how a pendulum returns back to its original position, I picked up my pen.
                I began drawing constantly, like how I would as a kid when I would draw leaves that I'd collect or bugs I would find under a rock. The level of commitment and discipline which
                I demanded of myself during my time there translated directly into a high level of patience in developing my artistry. The keystone piece during all of this was 
                "Earth" which took me 2 months and I completed <a href=# class="artwork">Neptune</a> and started on <a href=# class="artwork">Venus</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                Though it has taken me time to come to this understanding, it is this. If you care about something enough, material or immaterial,
                you will be willing to spend the time that it takes to get it right. I love art. If you asked me about some famous classical artist I would 
                look at you in puzzlement as my historical knowledge is awful, however art is something that I see at every level of human creation. I see it in the poise 
                of a random woman walking down the street, the placement of buildings in a town, or even in anyone's manner of speech.
                </p>

                <P>
                I have decided recently that I am okay with things taking time, as my life has finally slowed down. That is why I made this shitty
                website from scratch because I want every thing I create to feel personal to the viewer but most importantly, ME!
                </P>
