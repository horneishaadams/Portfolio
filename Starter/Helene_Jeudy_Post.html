                    Bjork once said that the iconic Kate Bush was the artist that inspired her to "let her sounds out". I do not actually know if that is true because I read it 
                    on some Youtube comment under one of her videos, but I reference that to say that this artist is that for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Helene Jeudy is a visual artist based out of Brussels, Belgium known her for distinct black-and-white surreal comic style. I first found her artwork on a late night where I was
                    trying to finish a lame embroidery art project that our high school teacher made us do. I was sitting there at my desk poking holes through cardstock with thread as I trying to create a 
                    hot pink sting ray floating around a Prismacolor rock formation. Do not ask how I came up with that concept.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p> 
                    I put my needle down and started scrolling, when this interesting video came up called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqaAs_3azSs" class="video-link">Anvil</a> came up
                    in my recommended videos. I turned my lights off and hit play. And then again. And then again. 
                    </p>
                    <div style="float: right; margin: 10px;">
                        <img src="assets\images\blog images\Vilcom_HJ.jpg" alt="" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                    It was one of the most unique art works I had ever seen. Helene Jeudy's interesting typographic style and Antoine Caecke's ability to bring it all to life through animation
                    just captivated me. But the most jarring of the emotions that I had felt was a sense of familiarity with the style. The heavy linewieghts in the typographic style reminded me of my
                    study of Japanese and Arabic caligraphy. The array of buildings across the cityscape had a visual rythym to it that I had not felt in sometime. The sharp, jagged structures and 
                    abstracted elements demanded focus from the viewer but also felt dream-like in their presentation. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    I looked down at my tangled mess of purple string and worn down Prismacolor pencils and asked myself "What the fuck am I doing?". I opened my drawer and started to dig. I 
                    shoved aside dried out paintbrushes, scraps of paper and sharp thumbtacks until I found it. A single Micron pen. I started just randomly drawing coral. Then that turned to fish.
                    Then it became plants and then I just started drawing lines and every thing I could possibly think of until I hit the top of the 19" x 24" sheet of paper. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    The result was my first pen and ink drawing which I call "Dominion". Faintly in the background, you will see my old Instagram handle. Yikes.
